    <h1> You Are A BadAss </h1>
    <ul class="list-blog">
        <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">1.	Introduction –</span> It’s about getting clear about what makes you happy & what makes you feel most alive, and then create it instead of pretending you need to go from wanting to change your life to deciding to change. Wanting can be done sitting in the couch, deciding means jumping all the way doing whatever it takes and going after your dreams. If you put your desire aside roll up your sleeves takes some risks, and totally go for it, you’ll wake up one day and realizing, you’re living the kind of life you used to be jealous of.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">2.	The G word – </span>Everything you desire or don’t is vibrating at a certain frequency, vibrations attract like vibrations. Focus on that which makes you feel good and ye shall find / attract that makes you feel good. Raise your frequency.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">3.	Present as a pigeon –</span> if you are depressed you are living in the past, if you are anxious, you are living in future, if you are at peace you are living in the present.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">4.	Embrace your inner badass –</span> do and have everything your little heart desired, Ditch the self-deprecating humour (don’t make fun of yourself).
            Our thoughts become our words, our words become our beliefs, our belief became our actions, our actions become our habits and our habit becomes our realities.
            Change your habits by changing your thoughts.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">5.	What are you doing here –</span> Every single person is born with a unique and valuable gifts to share with the world, once we figure out what our area, and decide to live our lives putting them to use that’s when  the real party begins. Steps—
            -	Be the Alien 
            -	Take the first right step – most answers reveal themselves through doing not thinking.
            -	Don’t reinvent the wheel – look around people whose life makes you totally jealous, and figure out what makes you feel alive.
            -	Don’t get caught up in thunderbolt hype.
            -	Follow your fantasies – if you had unlimited supply of money what will you do.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">6.	Your brain is your bitch – </span>mind is the master power that moulds and makes, a man is mind and evermore it takes, the tools of thought and shaping what he wills, bring forth a thousand joy and a thousand ills, he thinks in secret and it come to pass, Environment is but his looking glass- James Allen.
            Our thoughts are the most powerful tools, we got, steps-
            -	As and it is given – clear out the chatter in your brain
            -	Act as if – e.g. if you want something badly, believe it is possible
            -	Make a vision board</li>
         <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> 7.	It’s so easy once you figure out it isn’t hard – </span>Life is an illusion created by your perception and it can be changed the moment you choose to change it.
            What you choose to focus on becomes your reality (e.g. count red colours around), all you have to do id to let go all your present stories & rewrite a new one that fits who you truly are. Get out of your routine – talk to strangers, wear something different, learn 3 new jokes, walk taller, notice 5 awesome things.</li>
         <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">8.	Fear for success – </span>we have made being in a fear a habit, we’re taught to play it safe and not take risks. Fear lives in the future, it has been made up because it haven’t happen e.g. death, going bankrupt, getting rejected. Behave like a free spirit, screw it, I’m going for it and suddenly the thrill overtakes fear.</li>
         <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">9.	Millions of mirrors – </span>What you focus on you create more of in your life, if you are consciously or subconsciously focus on certain beliefs about who you are or who you want to be or who you don’t want, you will attract people who mirrors those traits right back to you.
            No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. The only failure is quitting, everything else is just gathering information.</li>
         <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">10.	Doing V/S Spewing – </span>Each time you grow you get to learn something new, which basically means you have to get uncomfortable, because new level means new level means new challenge and experiences.
            New level new Devil (get comfortable to new change)
            Read your manifesto write down your goals your visions of ideal life in present time, where do you live, who so you live with, what do you do for fun etc.</li>
